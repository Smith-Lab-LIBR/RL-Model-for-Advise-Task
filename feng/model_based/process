init free parameters:
    start SPM with the free parameters
    init the model wiht free parameters
         init the probability table [state=start, advise left, advise right, action= left, right, advise, result=win, lose]
         for all the trail in the data set
            time step 1
                compute the expected value of all the action
                pick the action with the highest expected value
                compare with the ground truth action, update the probability table using the update rule
            if time step 2 exists

                if advise is left
                    compute the expected value of left and advise action 
                    compute the expected value of right and advise action 
                    pick the action with the highest expected value
                    compare with the ground truth action, update the probability table using the update rule
                if advise is right
